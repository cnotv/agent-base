## Shared agreements

These rules come from `cnotv/agent-base` and apply to every repository that carries this
block. The block is managed: edit it in agent-base, never here, and let the dashboard's
"Sync" open the pull request that updates it. What is specific to this repository lives
outside the block, under **Project facts** and the repository's own sections.

### How work starts

Run the `start` skill first. It classifies the request and names the workflow to follow.
Every workflow that changes the repository opens an issue, a branch and a draft pull request,
in that order, before any code:

1. **The issue.** One that already exists is read, comments included; otherwise it is written
   from the request. If intent, scope or expected behaviour is unclear, ask one focused
   question covering everything missing, wait, and write it from the answer.
2. **The branch**, off main, named `<type>/<issue-number>-<description>`. A fresh branch every
   time, never the current one, never reused.
3. **The draft pull request**, opened at the first commit rather than the last, carrying
   `Closes #<issue-number>` and kept current as the work moves.

`start-issue` covers the first two steps and `open-pr` the third. Tests come first, except for
an exploratory prototype, which still owes them before the pull request is marked ready.

### Working agreements

- **Ask before assuming.** If intent, scope or expected behaviour is unclear, ask one focused
  question covering everything missing, and wait.
- **Give an opinion.** When asked what you think, say what you would do and why. Never stop at
  "it depends".
- **Write it once, at the length it earns.** Prose that repeats the diff or restates something
  already written is noise. Each kind of writing has one home, listed under Project facts.
- **Never loosen a lint rule to pass it**, never use `eslint-disable` in any form, and never
  `--no-verify`. If a hook or a rule fails, it is usually right.
- **No emoji** anywhere — code, comments, UI text, commit messages, documentation — unless
  explicitly requested.
- **Prefer a debugger over logging.** When a fix has failed twice, add logging at the relevant
  paths to see the real runtime values before trying again.

### Code

- **TypeScript only**, no `any`, and never `as SomeType` on unvalidated external data.
- **Functional style.** No classes, no `for` / `while` loops; prefer pure functions and `const`,
  and return new values rather than mutating.
- **Long descriptive names**, small single-purpose functions.
- **Exported types live in a types module** containing only type declarations.
- **Config files hold data, never logic.**
- **Update every call site** when a signature, type or export changes. No overloads, shims or
  deprecated aliases to keep old callers working.
- **Comments explain why, never what.**
- **DRY and KISS.** Extract a pattern the second time it appears; prefer the simplest thing
  that works. Reuse what the repository already has before writing something new.

### Git

- Branches are `<type>/<issue-number>-<description>` (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`,
  `test`, `chore`).
- **Rebase, never merge**: `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`, then
  `git push --force-with-lease`, never `--force`, never `git pull`.
- **Commit subjects never reference an issue number.** Write `<type>: <summary>`; the branch
  carries the number and the pull request body carries `Closes #<issue-number>`.
- **Pull request titles end with the issue number**: `<type>: <summary> (#<issue-number>)`,
  for example `feat: GitHub sign-in and a cloud deployment (#6)`. GitHub links it, and a
  squash merge appends the pull request number, so `main` reads `… (#6) (#7)`. This is for
  the title only; commits keep the rule above.

### Pull request evidence

A pull request that changes anything visible carries one screenshot and one video. The
shared `pr-preview` workflow records both from the running app; put a `Preview route: /path`
line in the body when the change is not on the default route, and `Preview click:` and
`Preview show:` lines when it is folded away or below the fold.

### Definition of done

- [ ] The repository's checks listed under Project facts pass, and you saw them pass
- [ ] The repository's own done-checklist under Project facts is walked
- [ ] The issue and the pull request still describe the work accurately
- [ ] Every artifact the issue named exists
